                <h2>Brief History of the Church</h2>
                <p>
                    On the 30th of May 2020, a group of believers gathered at the residence of  Pastor Sam MAKANJU for the first meeting of Dayspring Seraphic Church.
                    A few years before then, the lead Pastor who has been a minister of the gospel while in college has received instructions from God to start a local assembly where God's word will be taught with utmost simplicity and men are empowered for the work of ministry. Pastor Sam has been engaged by God in outreaches, teaching meetings, and conferences in schools, villages, and to vulnerable groups. He started his Pastoral journey in 2018 when he was ordained into the pastoral ministry of C&S Movement Church Worldwide, where he pastored the English Chapel of the District Headquarter before being sent-forth with blessings by the leadership of the church.
