                <h2>Brief History of the Church</h2>
                <p>
                    On the 30th of May 2020, a group of believers gathered at the residence of  Pastor Sam MAKANJU for the first meeting of Dayspring Seraphic Church.
                    A few years before then, the lead Pastor who has been a minister of the gospel while in college has received instructions from God to start a local assembly where God's word will be taught with utmost simplicity and men are empowered for the work of ministry. Pastor Sam has been engaged by God in outreaches, teaching meetings, and conferences in schools, villages, and to vulnerable groups. He started his Pastoral journey in 2018 when he was ordained into the pastoral ministry of C&S Movement Church Worldwide, where he pastored the English Chapel of the District Headquarter before being sent-forth with blessings by the leadership of the church.

                <p>STATEMENT OF FAITH</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We believe and take the 66 books of old and new testament as scripture, and in their original writing as fully inspired by God and accept them as the supreme and final authority for doctrine, correction and instructions for faith and life. </li>
                        <li> We believe in God, eternally existing in three persons - Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</li>
                        <li> We believe that Jesus Christ was begotten of the Father, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary and is true God and true man.</li>
                        <li> We believe that God created man in his own image; that man sinned and thereby incurred the penalty of death, physically and spiritually: and that all human beings inherit a sinful nature.</li>
                        <li> We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ died for our sins as a substitutionary sacrifice accordingly to the scriptures and that all who believe in him are Justified on the grounds of his shed blood.</li>
                        <li> We believe in the bodily resurrection of the Lord Jesus. His ascension into Heaven and his present life as our High Priest and Advocate at the right hand of the father.</li>
                        <li> We believe that all who repent of their sin and receive the Lord Jesus Christ by faith are born again of the Holy Spirit and Hereby become children of God.</li>
                        <li> We believe in the personal return of the Lord Jesus Christ for the church.</li>
                        <li> We believe in the baptism in the Holy Spirit, empowering and equipping believers for service with the accompanying supernatural gifts of the Holy Spirit; and in fellowship with the Holy Spirit. We believe in the divinely ordained ministries of Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Pastor and Teacher.</li>
                        <li> We believe in the resurrection of both the just and unjust, the eternal blessedness of the redeemed and eternal banishment of those who have rejected the offer of salvation.</li>
                        <li> We believe in the office of Elders, and deacons to carry the responsibility of help, oversight and care for God's people.  And  Where necessary, elders must carry out biblical discipline for the protection of the local church.</li>
                        <li> We believe in the principle of heterosexual relationships between a natural man and a natural woman within the confines of lawful matrimony.</li>
                        <li> We believe in the priesthood of all believers, and that the man in Christ is a minister of the gospel.</li>
                        <li> We belong to a  denomination that originated from South west Nigeria founded by God's servant Apostle Moses Orimolade.</li>
